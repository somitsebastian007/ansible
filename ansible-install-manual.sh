How key based SSH Works (Behind the Scenes):
------------------------------------------
=> When Ansible runs a playbook or module, it uses ssh to connect.
=> SSH client uses the private key to generate a cryptographic signature.
=> The remote SSH server (on the managed node) checks if the public key exists in authorized_keys.
=> If it does, it uses a challenge-response mechanism to verify the private key matches the public key.
=> If verified, access is granted â€” no password needed.
