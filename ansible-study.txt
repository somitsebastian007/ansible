# ansible version
ansible --version

# Ping Command
ansible all -m ping

# Inventory
[webservers]
web1 ansible_host=192.168.1.10
web2 ansible_host=192.168.1.11

# Host Variables
[webservers]
web1 ansible_host=192.168.1.10 ansible_user=ubuntu

Note:
If you do not explicitly mention ansible_user in your Ansible inventory or playbook, 
Ansible will use the current user running the Ansible command on the control machine

# Group Variables => group_vars/webservers.yml
# Same name present in invenetory  # Create under same /etc/ansible dir
ansible_user: ubuntu
package_name: apache2


# execute shell command
ansible all -m shell -a "uptime"

# execute playbook
ansible-playbook -i inventory_file playbook.yml -l group_name

=============================================

Host Variables with ansible_user
Example 1: Different users per host
# inventory.ini
[web1]
172.31.84.179 ansible_user=ubuntu

[web2]
172.31.90.15 ansible_user=user1

=============================================

Group Variables with ansible_user
# inventory.ini
[web1]
172.31.84.179 ansible_user=ubuntu

[web1:vars]
ansible_user=prod_admin 
#
[web2]
172.31.90.15 ansible_user=user1

[web2:vars]
ansible_user=stage_user

=============================================

Ansible Modules
----------------
Modules are the building blocks of Ansible - they are small programs that Ansible pushes out to 
remote nodes to execute specific tasks. Each module performs a specific function like installing 
a package, copying a file, or managing a service.

Common Module Categories and Examples:
1. System Modules -> apt and service
# Install a package (apt module for Debian/Ubuntu)
- name: Install httpd
  apt:
    name: httpd
    state: present
    update_cache: yes

# Start and enable a service
- name: Ensure httpd is running and enabled
  service:
    name: httpd
    state: started
    enabled: yes

Full Playbook with apt and service modules:
- name: Install and configure httpd on Debian/Ubuntu
  hosts: web1
  become: yes
  tasks:

    - name: Install httpd
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
        update_cache: yes

    - name: Ensure httpd is running and enabled
      service:
        name: apache2
        state: started
        enabled: yes

2. File Modules
# Copy a file to remote hosts
- name: Copy index.html
  copy:
    src: files/index.html
    dest: /var/www/html/index.html
    owner: root
    group: root
    mode: '0644'

# Create a directory
- name: Create logs directory
  file:
    path: /var/log/myapp
    state: directory
    mode: '0755'

Full playbook with copy and file module:
---------------------------------------
- name: Copy index.html and create log directory on remote hosts
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:

    - name: Copy index.html
      copy:
        src: files/index.html
        dest: /var/www/html/index.html
        owner: root
        group: root
        mode: '0644'

    - name: Create logs directory
      file:
        path: /var/log/myapp
        state: directory
        mode: '0755'


=============================================

Ansible Ad-Hoc Commands
-----------------------
Ad-hoc commands are quick one-liners you can run to perform simple tasks without writing a playbook. 
They're great for quick checks or simple operations.

1. Ping all hosts in inventory
ansible all -m ping

2. Check disk space on web servers
ansible webservers -m command -a "df -h"

3. Install a package on Debian systems
ansible debian_servers -m apt -a "name=nginx state=present" -b
-b stands for "become" (run with sudo)

4. Copy a file to multiple servers
ansible webservers -m copy -a "src=/local/path/file.txt dest=/remote/path/file.txt"

5. Run a shell command
ansible db_servers -m shell -a "uptime"

=============================================

Handlers
--------
Handlers are a special type of task in Ansible that only run when notified by another task.
They're typically used to perform actions that should only happen once, even if triggered 
multiple times, such as restarting services or reloading configurations.

---
- name: Example playbook with handlers
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache web server
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
      notify: restart apache

    - name: Ensure Apache is running
      service:
        name: apache2
        state: started

  handlers:
    - name: restart apache
      service:
        name: apache2
        state: restarted

=============================================

Roles:
------
An Ansible Role is a way to organize playbooks, files, templates, and other Ansible components into 
a reusable, standalone structure. Roles provide a framework for fully independent or interdependent 
collections of variables, tasks, files, templates, and modules.

Key Benefits of Roles:
--------------------
=> Simplification: Make complex playbooks easier to understand and maintain
=> Reusability: Write once, use many times across different playbooks
=> Standardization: Enforce consistent directory structures

A typical Ansible role has this directory structure:
--------------------------------------------------
role_name/
    ├── defaults/         # Default variables (lowest precedence)
    ├── vars/             # Other variables (higher precedence)
    ├── files/            # Static files to be copied
    ├── templates/        # Jinja2 templates
    ├── tasks/            # Main task list
    ├── handlers/         # Handlers (triggered tasks)
    ├── meta/             # Role dependencies
    ├── library/          # Custom modules
    ├── lookup_plugins/   # Custom lookup plugins
    └── tests/            # Test playbooks

Practical: Creating an Nginx Web Server Role
--------------------------------------------

Step 1: Create the Role Structure
=> ansible-galaxy init nginx_role

Step 2: Define the Role Components
(a) Tasks (tasks/main.yml): Define the steps to install and configure Nginx.
---
- name: Install Nginx
  apt:
    name: nginx
    state: present
    update_cache: yes
  become: yes

- name: Ensure Nginx is running
  service:
    name: nginx
    state: started
    enabled: yes
  become: yes

- name: Copy Nginx configuration file
  template:
    src: nginx.conf.j2
    dest: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    mode: '0644'
  become: yes
  notify: Restart Nginx


(b) Handlers (handlers/main.yml): Define actions triggered by tasks, like restarting Nginx.
---
- name: Restart Nginx
  service:
    name: nginx
    state: restarted
  become: yes

(c) Templates (templates/nginx.conf.j2): Create a Jinja2 template for the Nginx configuration.
user www-data;
worker_processes auto;
pid /run/nginx.pid;

events {
    worker_connections {{ nginx_worker_connections | default(768) }};
}

http {
    sendfile on;
    tcp_nopush on;
    tcp_nodelay on;
    keepalive_timeout 65;
    types_hash_max_size 2048;

    include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
    default_type application/octet-stream;

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name {{ server_name | default('localhost') }};

        root /var/www/html;
        index index.html;

        location / {
            try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
        }
    }
}

(d) Defaults (defaults/main.yml): Set default variables for the role.
---
nginx_worker_connections: 1024
server_name: example.com

(e) Files (files/index.html): Add a sample static HTML file to serve.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Welcome to Nginx!</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello from Ansible-managed Nginx!</h1>
</body>
</html>

(f) Copy the HTML file (Add to tasks/main.yml):
- name: Copy static HTML file
  copy:
    src: index.html
    dest: /var/www/html/index.html
    mode: '0644'
  become: yes

(e) Create a Playbook to Use the Role (outside the role folder)
---
- name: Deploy Nginx web server
  hosts: localhost
  become: yes
  roles:
    - nginx_role
